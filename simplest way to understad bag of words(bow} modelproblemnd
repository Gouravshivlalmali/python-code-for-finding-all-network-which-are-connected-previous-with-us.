The Bow model is used for changing the arbitrary taxt into fixed length vector's 
by counting hoewmany times each word apears. this process often ts as vectorization.

lets understand this with the a simple quick example,

we have a data like 
 > dog like bone 
 > dog eat bone
 > dog don't like cats
 
 we'll first refers each all text as document
 
 Step 1. Determine the vocabulary
  in our above data we have 3 document we first take each word without 
  repeating. there are three documents above.
  words are, 
  {dog,like,bone,eat,don't,cats}
  
 Step 2. count
  in step 2 we count all word how many its come. 
  
 
                         dog  like  bone  eat  don't  cats
  dog like bone       :   1     1     1    0    0       0     
  dog eat bone dog happy       :   1     1     2    1    0       
  dog don't like cats :
